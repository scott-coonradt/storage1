# Objective
- Move 2 models over to Aurora to get us below the 700k contract limit by 31-May-2025.


# Challenges
- Doing new development with tools we have not used before requires an unpredictable learning curve.
- Our biggest models also have downstream dependents that will require some careful porting.
- The data and objects have new requirements that we have not dealt with before.
- Ability to make wise decisions under an iterative pattern is imperitive to building a succesful foundation.
- It takes time reviewing options and getting the team on board with the shortest path forward.
- We are planning on taking some short cuts (hardcoded values in the code) to get us over the hump.
- Proposed the desire to start developing this over 9 months ago as it should not be a last minute fire drill.

# another Challenge
- Cutover to suppor this effort was a couple weeks back but they continue to get pulled into things.
- I understand that the SFTP issue was one that had to be addressed, bet there are others.
- To mitigate this transition issue, I have talked with Chris and he promises they will be closing many things out this week.
- I have also asked Chris for an additional part time resource starting next week to help with PROD data population while we continue down our development and porting path.

# Closing
- Excited by the oppertuinty to do new development to replace the MDH out.
